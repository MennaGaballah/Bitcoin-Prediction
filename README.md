# Bitcoin-Prediction
This project is a Streamlit-powered web application that predicts the closing price of Bitcoin using multiple deep learning models.

The app enables users to input key market data—such as opening price, high, low, and volume—for a specific date, and generates predicted closing prices using the following trained models:
    Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
    Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
    Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
    Ensemble Voting Model
